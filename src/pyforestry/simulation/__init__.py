"""Simulation utilities for managing model state.

The :mod:`pyforestry.simulation` package collects helpers that are useful when
running growth or yield simulations.  Modules here focus on orthogonal
concerns such as checkpointing model state and preparing inputs for external
engines rather than prescribing a particular simulator implementation.
